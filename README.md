work-in-progress
================

This repository is for android apps that I've been working on, most of which are just for fun.
In the future this repositoty will be used for all mobile apps I write.

Sean Dayo: 
Sean Dayo is clothing line based in Dar es salaam, Tanzania. The app is meant to offer fans of Sean Dayo a place to view latest updates from Sean Dayo clothing line and as a channel to communicate with the people behind Sean Dayo and software Developers

Habari Hub: 
Habari Hub is an idea to create a lightweight all-in-one news hub from Tanzania media, being a Tanzanian abroad I found it difficult to keep up with all home news or I just felt lazy to visit every page and listening to all internet radio channels. Once this app is done it will make its way to iOS and other platforms, and I hope it will be useful to all Tanzanians abroad


About Me:
Simple and Confident, I dream big about computing. Full time Linux user and a self-proclaimed Linux ambassador. I believe in FOSS, I believe in Freedom.
