work-in-progress
================
 
Habari Hub is an idea to create a lightweight all-in-one news hub from Tanzania media, being a Tanzanian abroad I found it difficult to keep up with all home news or I just felt lazy to visit every page and listening to all internet radio channels. Once this app is done it will make its way to iOS and other platforms, and I hope it will be useful to all Tanzanians abroad
